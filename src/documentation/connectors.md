##Connectors

Data connectors allow you to connect your visualizations to source data in different formats. 

* CSV provides connectivity to comma-separated values.
* TSV provides connectivity to tab-separated values.
* All data connectors include several selectors for dimensions and measures, and for filtering data sets.
